# Multi-Modal Recommender Systems: Towards Addressing Sparsity and Comparability

Web applications frequently feature a recommender system to help users discover
items (e.g., products, content articles) of interest. At Amazon, recommender
systems play a key role in aiding our customers navigating myriads of choices.
This tutorial focuses on multi-modality, i.e., the use of side information such as text,
images, or graphs to augment preference data. In particular, we cover two important
aspects of multi-modality. First is how models rely on the auxiliary modality to
address the sparsity of preference observations in order to better bridge users and
items. These models are typically designed along modality lines, which we cover
comprehensively. Second is how to manage comparison and cross-utilization of
multi-modal models. The former is concerned with streamlining the treatment of
models that share the same modality. The latter is concerned with using a model
initially designed for one modality with another. This tutorial is meant for both
practitioners seeking applicable experience, as well researchers interested in recent
and future research directions in multimodal recommender systems.
